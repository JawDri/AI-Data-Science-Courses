Recurrent Networks are an exciting type of neural network that deal with data that come in the form of a sequence. Sequences are all around us such as sentences, music, videos, and stock market graphs. And dealing with them requires some type of memory element to remember the history of the sequences, this is where Recurrent Neural networks come in.

We will be covering topics such as RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, NLP, Seq2Seq, attention networks and much much more.

We will also be building projects, such as a Time series Prediction, music generator, language translation, image captioning, spam detection, action recognition and much more.

Building these projects will impress even the most senior machine learning developers; and will prepare us to start tackling ourr own deep learning projects with real datasets to show off to your colleagues or even potential employers.

Sequential Networks are very exciting to work with and allow for the creation of very intelligent applications.
