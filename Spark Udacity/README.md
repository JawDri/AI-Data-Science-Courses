In this course, we’ll learn how to use Spark to work with big data and build machine learning models at scale, including how to wrangle and model massive datasets with PySpark, the Python library for interacting with Spark. In the first lesson, we will learn about big data and how Spark fits into the big data ecosystem. In lesson two, we will be practicing processing and cleaning datasets to get comfortable with Spark’s SQL and dataframe APIs. In the third lesson, we will debug and optimize your Spark code when running on a cluster. In lesson four, we will use Spark’s Machine Learning Library to train machine learning models at scale.
